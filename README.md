# Xapo iOS project

This is a project used to evaluate candidate's coding skills and iOS knowledge.

# Description

The projectâ€™s idea is to list trending projects from Github, tap on one of them, and show their details.
The first screen of the app is described on this [Figma link](https://www.figma.com/file/5JrLNhD1etjj9FIfmpwe93/Untitled?node-id=0%3A1)

## Requirements

- Write your application in Swift.
- Ensure your application is compatible with the latest version of iOS. (The layout of the screens must work on all supported iOS 13 devices (iPhone SE 1st gen, iPhone 11 Pro Max)
- Add at least one UIKit coordinated animation.
- Use good architecture and design patterns.

*Bonu*s: Unit tests and reactive programming

If there is something not specified, please be free to decide on it. Let me know if you need something, or you have any doubt about the project.

# Handover

Whenever you are done, just create a release in github or contact HR!
